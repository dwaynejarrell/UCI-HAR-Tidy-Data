# UCI-HAR-Tidy-Data
## Final Project for Getting and Cleaning Data
### run_analysis.R
This program reads in the various components of the UCI Samsung HAR data and combines them into a tidy, more usable dataset.
Only mean and standard deviation (std) measures are kept, along with the subject number and activity type for each of the measurements taken.
In addition, the script creates a summary dataset that contains the averages for all of the mean and std measures in the initial dataset, grouped by subject and activity.
